Noumenal-B changelog:

__v2.0.1:__  
__HUB__:
- Updated tooltips to be more consistent.
- Bug fixed: in parallel mode, channels got muted when one or more Paths were unused.
- Feature tweak: creating involuntary feedback is harder now: setting a Stage vca to zero prevents signal send and kills the feedback loop.
- Interface update: Shrank Path selection switches (lights) by ~20% so the Stage mix knob area is easier to grab.
